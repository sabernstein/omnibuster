“(ii) Special rule for short taxable years.—If an election is made under clause (i) for a taxable year which is a short taxable year, the adjusted taxable income for the taxpayer’s last taxable year beginning in 2019 which is substituted under clause (i) shall be equal to the amount which bears the same ratio to such adjusted taxable income determined without regard to this clause as the number of months in the short taxable year bears to 12”
