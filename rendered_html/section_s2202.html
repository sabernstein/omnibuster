            <p> SEC. 2202. SPECIAL RULES FOR USE OF RETIREMENT FUNDS.(a) Tax-favored Withdrawals From Retirement Plans.—(1) In general.—Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any coronavirus-related distribution.

(2) Aggregate dollar limitation.—(A) In general.—For purposes of this subsection, the aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual which may be treated as coronavirus-related distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed $100,000.

(B) Treatment of plan distributions.—If a distribution to an individual would (without regard to subparagraph (A)) be a coronavirus-related distribution, a plan shall not be treated as violating any requirement of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats such distribution as a coronavirus-related distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such distributions from all plans maintained by the employer (and any member of any controlled group which includes the employer) to such individual exceeds $100,000.

(C) Controlled group.—For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term “controlled group” means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.


(3) Amount distributed may be repaid.—(A) In general.—Any individual who receives a coronavirus-related distribution may, at any time during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date on which such distribution was received, make 1 or more contributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which such individual is a beneficiary and to which a rollover contribution of such distribution could be made under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as the case may be.

(B) Treatment of repayments of distributions from eligible retirement plans other than iras.—For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if a contribution is made pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a coronavirus-related distribution from an eligible retirement plan other than an individual retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to the extent of the amount of the contribution, be treated as having received the coronavirus-related distribution in an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) of such Code) and as having transferred the amount to the eligible retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of the distribution.

(C) Treatment of repayments of distributions from iras.—For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if a contribution is made pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a coronavirus-related distribution from an individual retirement plan (as defined by section 7701(a)(37) of such Code), then, to the extent of the amount of the contribution, the coronavirus-related distribution shall be treated as a distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as having been transferred to the eligible retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of the distribution.


(4) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection—(A) Coronavirus-related distribution.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term “coronavirus-related distribution” means any distribution from an eligible retirement plan made—(i) on or after January 1, 2020, and before December 31, 2020,

(B) Employee certification.—The administrator of an eligible retirement plan may rely on an employee’s certification that the employee satisfies the conditions of subparagraph (A)(ii) in determining whether any distribution is a coronavirus-related distribution.

(C) Eligible retirement plan.—The term “eligible retirement plan” has the meaning given such term by section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.


(5) Income inclusion spread over 3-year period.—(A) In general.—In the case of any coronavirus-related distribution, unless the taxpayer elects not to have this paragraph apply for any taxable year, any amount required to be included in gross income for such taxable year shall be so included ratably over the 3-taxable-year period beginning with such taxable year.

(B) Special rule.—For purposes of subparagraph (A), rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (E) of section 408A(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply.


(6) Special rules.—(A) Exemption of distributions from trustee to trustee transfer and withholding rules.—For purposes of sections 401(a)(31), 402(f), and 3405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, coronavirus-related distributions shall not be treated as eligible rollover distributions.
