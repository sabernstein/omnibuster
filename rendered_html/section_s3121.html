(B) may increase the average participation cap for eligible individuals applicable to grantees as described in section 502(b)(1)(C) of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3056(b)(1)(C)) to a cap the Secretary determines is appropriate due to the effects of the COVID–19 public health emergency declared under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d); and


(2) may increase the amount available to pay the authorized administrative costs for a project, described in section 502(c)(3) of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3056(c)(3)) to an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the grant amount if the Secretary determines that such increase is necessary to adequately respond to the additional administrative needs to respond to the COVID–19 public health emergency declared under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d).
