                        <proviso>
<i> Provided</i>, That such authority to transfer may not be used unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress: 
                        
                        </proviso>

<i> Provided further</i>, That the Secretary of Defense shall notify the Congress promptly of all transfers made pursuant to this authority or any other authority in this Act: 
                        
                        </proviso>
<proviso>
<i> Provided further</i>, That no part of the funds in this Act shall be available to prepare or present a request to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate for reprogramming of funds, unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which reprogramming is requested has been denied by the Congress: 
                        
                        </proviso>
<proviso>
<i> Provided further</i>, That a request for multiple reprogrammings of funds using authority provided in this section shall be made prior to June 30, 2021: 
                        
                        </proviso>
